-- | This module provides a ContentsListBypass type which is required to
-- somewhat subvert the type system we use to ensure that anything passed to
-- 'reply' is a valid WireFormat instance.
--
-- In the case of reading contents lists from Ceph, we already have a valid
-- wireformat bytestring. It is just missing the Address. So given an (Address,
-- ByteString) tuple, we can transform it one-way into a ContentsListBypass in
-- such a way that:
--
-- forall SourceDict s.
-- forall Address a.
-- toWire (ContentsListBypass (a, toWire s)) == toWire (ContentsListEntry a s)
--
-- The point of this is to avoid re-parsing on egress from disk.
